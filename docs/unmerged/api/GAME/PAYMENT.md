# Payment
Seemingly rushed feature, unimplemented.

## Spending & giving KR <Badge type="danger" text="broken"/>
```krunkscript
# Charging KR from map
GAME.PAYMENTS.charge();             # unknown

GAME.PAYMENTS.giveKR(
    player,                         # player object
    val                             # int kr amount
);
```
